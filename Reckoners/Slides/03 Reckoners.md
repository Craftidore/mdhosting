# What is Reckoners?

---

![right|300](Pasted%20image%2020220106120814.png) <u>The Reckoners</u> is a book series by Brandon Sanderson. 12 years ago a bright red light appeared in the night sky.  Shortly afterward, people began manifesting what we would call super-powers. Soon, these super-powered humans, known as 'Epics', turned to crime. Governments, unable to police Epics, crumbled and infrastructure became scarce. It's been 12 years. There are no 'good' Epics and the only law of the land is 'might makes right'. But not everyone bows down to the Epics; a shadowy group of ordinary humans, the Reckoners spend their lives studying Epics, finding their weaknesses, and then taking them out.

You will be playing a team of Reckoners stuck in the city of Shattered Seattle.

## Reckoners RPG Setting

While this RPG will be set in the world of the Reckoners, nothing you'll be doing will have any particular relevence to the books.

What we're doing today is creating the city this RPG will be set in. There are a couple of things I've already decided about the city. 

* The city is called 'Shattered Seattle' and is located about where Seattle, Washington is in the real world. 
* The Epic more or less in-charge of the city is 'Queen Gravitron'. She has Gravity Manipulation powers and has flipped the city upside down (see diagram on next slide).
* The city has been shattered into floating chunks. 
  But that's all I've predeterminedâ€”it's an open canvas.

## Epics

* All Epics are evil. No exceptions. 
* All Epics have at least 1 Epic Power. 
  * Some Epics have very similar powers, just with different levels of strength. 
  * Some Epics have different powers with similar effects. One illusion epic might bend light around themselves, while another might edit themselves out of a person's mind.
* All Epics have a weakness that negates their Epic Powers. Reckoners try to find out Epic weaknesses to negate the powers of their targets before killing them.
