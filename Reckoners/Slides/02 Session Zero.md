## Content

If no one objects, let's keep everything under a PG rating, with PG-13-level violence. In addition, I'd ask that 

* There should be no cussing. Darn, heck, etc. are fine, as well as in-world curses like 'blast' in Star Wars.
* No sexual references or inuendo. 
  * Romance between two PCs is still fine (so long as both players aren't uncomfortable with it). 
  * Likewise, if you want your character to have a NPC husband/wife, that's fine.
* No LGBTQ etc. characters in this campaign.

## House Rules

<!-- Really just for Nate's benefit -->

* No homebrew talents except for the ones I have provided. 
* Gear will be taken from Something Strange
* Archetypes will be custom generated (see printoff), though I will also provide some presets.
* In addition to the skills on your character sheet, we will have 
  * Knowledge (Epics)
  * Knowledge (Pre-Calamity)
  * Knowledge (Apocalypse)
